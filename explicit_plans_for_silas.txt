~ Next Writing Activities ~

i think i'm done with shorts
...
the next thing i guess would be edit the 40k line fever dream thing
so it's less embarassing
...
but that has lots of 'non-capitalized prose'
...
and then there's some older journals
...
ugh

~ Next Social Activities ~

probably just youtube
i spent the last year not coding, 
so going through a bunch of old stuff
and then remembering it and 
making videos about 'how to make this stuff'
... that'd be cool

so, videos that'd be fun would be:

how to (stuff i already wrote):

- multibody sim    with javascript
- cloth sim        with javascript
- truss fea        with javascript + sushi.js
- 3d scene         with javascript + three.js
- code editor      with javascript + codemirror.js

- triangle         with webgl2
- mandelbrot       with webgl2
- julia set        with webgl2
- game of life     with webgl2
- fluid sim        with webgl2
- 3d scene         with webgl2 (do projection matrix stuff from scratch)

Programs i want to write over next year

2d Video Game (1 like zelda, 1 like mario (old nes))
- this is doable now because javascript is
  wayyy easier to write in than whatever languages they used back then

Point and Click Fea
- i already made a matlab program like this
  i want to do a new one 'from scratch'

Mini-language that compiles to Wasm
- need to study a lot about
- - wasm byte code
- - wasm text format
- - compilers
- - text processing
- - a lot of stuff

WebGL2 Shortcut Library
- texture fn
- shader fn
- matrx fn's
- shapes?
...
basically like a mini three.js
(obviously will not be 'as good', but a fun project)
...
and if i study enough
i might eventually be able
to contribute to those bigger projects

PROBABLY UNREALISTIC GOALS IN SOFTWARE
--------------------------------------
contribute to:
- vulkan
- gpu architecture
- cpu architecture
- quantum shit
...
ugh
...
capitols

THE DREAM
---------
study web stuff
make friends along the way
maybe one day
contribute at khronos level
but understand
i probably won't
and like those guys
because they're awesome
not be all pissed
that i'll never be at vulkan level
(already had practice with this with coltrane)

WORD DEATH
----------
so ... i'm probably gonna go back to doing stuff
everyone thinks is 'retarded and autistic'
...
things like 'learning'
...
ugh
