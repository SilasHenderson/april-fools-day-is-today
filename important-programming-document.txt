HOW I WROTE THIS
----------------
i woke up with a bunch of spider bites and dialated pupils
and wrote for 40 hours straight
while laughing maniacally
then slept it off

some poems, like 'i am the new emporer'
were written while i was seeing the icons on my computer
morph and do other weird shit
so, the sacriledge of it all was funny
just messing with the big computer

anyway, i hope this sufficiently explains this important programming document
...
and now it's edited a bit also
