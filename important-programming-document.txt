shakespear wrote 
a bunch of stories about that shit
maybe he's 'too difficult' for the kids

with a person who wants to live forever

like, they truly think 
they don't want to live forever
... but they secretly do
evidence: we get scared of things

STOKING THE PEASANTS WITH WORDS
-------------------------------
i've got to get back to math eventually
this word shit is ugh
like, the tv people really 
seem like they don't know

with the hot
and passed to laura
and got caut

resource for learning 
how to code
