"i don't respect xi, un, or putin: the musical!"

WHY RUSSIANS FIGHT A LOT
------------------------
alcohol

HOW TO HELP RUSSIANS
--------------------
strategic weed dropped from airplanes

XI JINPING GETS TRANSGENDER SURGERY
-----------------------------------
she 
gins up
and pins gs
(but you're 'definitely' different putin!)

WE HAVE HEART PROBLEMS
----------------------
is this ... legal to say?

CHALLENGE FOR XI, UN OR PUTIN
-----------------------------
demonstrate one skill you have beside extortion (why should i even care if you live?)

quick definition of 'extortion':
- be a bad dad  (scare people)
- be a good dad (then make them feel safe)

for instance, do any of you guys have any talent that
would make people like you if you lost all your power?
is that what you're worried about?

WHAT XI, UN AND PUTIN WILL SPEND THE REST OF THEIR LIVES DOING
--------------------------------------------------------------
trying to be 'the best dad'
this means: 'managing all the internet content to make sure they look like good dads'
aka they will live in more triangle hell (being the 'best triangle person' ... otherwise the world will blow up!)

PEOPLE I RESPECT MORE THAN XI, UN OR PUTIN
------------------------------------------
anyone who has demonstrated any actual skill

PROOF THEY ARE DEVILS
---------------------
they think 'computer extortion'
is 'not extortion'

WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE DO WE WANT TO POPULATE THE WORLD?
-----------------------------------------------------
- extorters?
- anything else?

WHAT XI, UN AND PUTIN THINK WILL HAPPEN
---------------------------------------
1) 'save the world'
2) 'control the internet'
3) 'be everybody's dad'

WHAT WILL ACTUALLY HAPPEN
-------------------------
we'll watch them show 'who they really are'

HOW TO MAKE XI, UN AND PUTIN NOT 'NUKE EVERYBODY'
-------------------------------------------------
1) make them feel 'safe'
2) make them feel 'important'
3) give them a 'bad guy' to 'be better than'
4) give them some 'project' that makes them feel like they'll 'have a real place in history'
5) like, a 'vr headset' for them ... the quicker we can just make them feel like they've won, the quicker we can start ignoring them

in short, just be super nice to them
but understand they don't have souls

and the computer people can help
flood their computers with 
positive messages about how much 
people love them
so they don't
torture more

until we get chips in their brains
so we can really help them 'live their fullest fantasy'

once again, the only way to deal with tyrants
is to make them feel like they've won
then study their vanity
to protect future generations
from getting tricked by a 'dad who 'really cares''
