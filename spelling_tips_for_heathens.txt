NO STARS TO BOOT
----------------
mom is information
dad is information
that's just
misinformation and 
disinformation

SPIKED PUNCH
------------
flashback to 1970's
...
manz 1: i'm gene tickey. i'm spiking da punch bowl
manz 2: coo
manz 3: i'm gozirra now
manz 2: coo
manz 1: that's PRESIDENT gozirra to you!

SHAKE my SPEAR
--------------
"to be or not to be?"
- that is the question
"are you fucking with me?"
- that is the ALWAYS question

HUNTER-A-CHU
------------
here's the pokemon recipe for '-----' type guys:
- spike da punch to give some dudes huge weiners
  to the point where they essentially are
  'predictable maniacs'
  because they have this 'big urge'
  and then have to develop a 
  'personality'

GREAT NEW SCHEMES FOR PROFIT AND SUCCESS
----------------------------------------
- eco-friendly cruise line
- woke service-economy

HOW WE DEAL WITH SOCIETAL PAIN
------------------------------
outlaw pain medicine
because those people taking pain medicine
are ... SELFISH!

NERD 'SOLVING REALITY' AT BREAK-NECK SPEED
------------------------------------------
who's got your belly?

CASTLES
-------
sometimes, i feel like the base-behavior 
for all science, art
... basically anything cool
is for some rich person to 'collect' it
...
just imagine if that'd been going on for several thousand years!

KEEPING UP WITH THE KAR ... CHINA
---------------------------------
rush ya
rush more
i'm confused

COPY YOUR WAY TO SUCCESS
------------------------
a really sad and difficult problem in ... academia?

CRYING LIKE WINSTON
-------------------
why?
i won a ton!

DEBBIE
------
what they'd call disinfo board in prison
... fuckin' debbie!

I AM SINGLE-HANDEDLY SAVING THE PLANET
--------------------------------------
where's my oatmeal?

WORD HATE METER
---------------
don't you know tea left?

MOONSHOT KNOW-IT-ALL
--------------------
a passing feeling of oneness
can leave you
chasing ... who?

YOU
---
'you' sometimes is like ... a really agressive word
it's like the '3' of the word kingdom

MY FAVORITE QUOTE FROM THE INTERNET
-----------------------------------
"if nuclear war saves just one life, it'll be worth it"

I'M SELFISH

no YOU sell fish!

NUDGE
-----

... bad luck?

INNER ANGST
-----------
no, it's DEFINITELY that!

IS INNER ANGST PHYSICS?
-----------------------
cue 'honest track' bezos conspiracy
... or some shit

A SILLY EXAMPLE OF INDIRECTION
------------------------------
't' stands for ... 'testosterone!'

I AM JESUS: THE SEQUEL
----------------------
okay, fine!
't' stands for ... testosterone
...
't' was a real problem back when they were developing language
everybody knows
oh, oh, oh!

TESTOSTERONE JESUS
------------------
hi ... my name is 'tj'

RAND PAUL IS TOTALLY NOT POPULAR
--------------------------------
it's sort of hilarious to see someone 
study a lot and then speak to a
completely unmoved void

ANGST MAP
---------
fancy brain
stupid brain
nerve endings
bones
local environment
earth
light
?

JENGA
-----
'construct validation'

SYMBOLIC LEAH AND XI VS. REAL LEAH AND XI
-----------------------------------------
i really hope that the 'experts'
at least understand that
i understand that
i have never even met these people
...
okay, maybe do a 'psychology' discussion?
so, i was into jung
and a lot of times, 'stars' represnt
'stars' withing my own psyche
so, whoever i listen to, 
there'll be some symbolic representation
of that character
so, with 'xi' it sort of gets 'intertwined' with the 'ancient emporer' symbol and then 'fat-cat' symbol into the 'xi has a big fake weiner' poem, which i really hope people understand i don't actually think ...
with leah, it clearly got intertwined with a mess of scientological madness.  the rogan interview helped me gain a little less skepticism.  guess it's a symbol of a hollywood person i'm instinctively mistrustful of, but she's probably not cooking up big secret plans.

CONFESSIONS
-----------
man, i'm so bored
...
okay
... 
gotta have a big 'writing' plan for today
...
i've got to spend at least 4 hours today writing
on this yoga mat
...
confessions are too lame
played out
...
gotta cook up ... a BIG PLAN!
...
re-edit 'game of iron'?
...
i've got to achieve ... MORAL VIRTUE!

CANADIAN NAZIS
--------------
okay ... people will believe anything
...
maybe at least just push it further?
to make the tragedy more apparent?
...
what's something even more silly?
ukrainian not-not-sees?
...
ugh
...
i suck
...
is not-not-see a 'double twist' move?
...
i guess 'eco-friendly cruise' and 'woke service-economy' are still the funniest
...
why can't i write cool shit all the time?
...
all this 'not-cool' writing as 'evidence' of my 'self-victimhood' or whatever 'bads' in the big word science thing

BEAUTIFUL WORDS THAT COMFORT THE GODS LIKE RAIN
-----------------------------------------------
shit!
i guess i've got to do more
'p --> r'
...
rich people want rain, not pain
they want to get washed, not challenged
...
going on this abstraction, as more SYMBOLIC FUCKING CHARACTERS
then, 
... ooops i forgot
ego stuff
...
defensiveness
...
trapped into worried about
'defending my triangle'
...
ummm

WEAKNESS IS INSANITY
--------------------
rich people wear stilts
so tall, so tall
poor people will build
so small, so small

BIG POWER BUSINESS MANZ
-----------------------
these guys always ...
i never give the 'big dick' vibe to them
...
why don't they just look at my dick?
...
why does 'stupid haircut' mean: i'm retarded and have a little dick?
...
people are so fucked up

KKKLEEEEEEEEN
-------------
i really hope one day i'll
get really into hygiene
...
ugh
...
and looking in the mirror alot
so people don't think i'm crazy
...
at least i'm showering more

MIRROR OF TRUTH
---------------
sanity means:
- looking in the mirror before you go out
  so people don't laugh at you
...
what i'm saying is ... back in the day
it was really obvious that people would 
hypnotize themselves with mirrors
...
now, you're crazy not to!

SUIT
----
it's so stupid that a 'long tie'
totally 'gets' people
that we 'bury it'
over and over

BERRY CRUNCH
------------
sometimes i think 
the whole earth is filled
with crazy fucking tragedy
and the diggers, the old archeologists
just found so much fucked up 'hypnosis shit'
and other madness
that they decided it's better
to just burn all that
and not see it
...
but then there's this weird problem
of jenga
...
i don't understand

GRAPPLING STUPIDLY WITH COMPLEXITY
----------------------------------
i'll try to edit this stuff later
writing and then 'posting'
feels more fun
now now now!

A HABITABLE ENVIRONMENT 'OUT OF CHAOS'
--------------------------------------
man, i really like this ... who is it?
jordan peterson interview

A CRUDE POINT
-------------
here i go again!

ANOTHER 'EXPLANATION' OF A 'POPULAR FIGURE'
-------------------------------------------
i don't think jay-z is an 'illuminati wizard'
here's a 'math' explanation
it's 'indirection' + 'derivatives'
and a funny, 'no-solution' problem
J: 'you do indirection for the illuminati'
Z: 'no i don't'

THE WORST DORK JOKE
-------------------
krod
door key
...
who is loo?

MORE MINDLESS GARBAGE
---------------------
why can't i think of something cool?
shit, i'm so bored

GIFTS FROM SANTA
----------------
oh, here's one:
i'm not a 'burn down the government' type
there's another side of 'the mystery'
that's: 'how did we not all blow everything up already?'
...
like ...
if i listened to 'my favorite things'
i'd probably seem way more 'safe'
than if i listened to 'interstellar space'
...
but they're both from the same person!
...
and then there's this really sad thing
where everybody already forgot so much music
that coltrane's last album seems 'crazy and pained'
...
that's a really convenient attitude to take towards something you didn't study!
...
so, with that example it's like
'i studied major and minor scales and 4/4 and 3/4 time, so that sounds 'sane' to me'
and if they hear 'not major and minor scales' then it sounds 'bad and stupid'
...
doesn't it make sense how we forget things?
...
it happens with music
...
keeping a culture together is ...
too complicated for me to understand
...
ugh
...

AT LEAST I'M NOT USING MY PRIVELEDGE FOR WAR AND OTHER HORRORS
--------------------------------------------------------------
so ...
i'm a ... big angry ... word writer?

A GRAVE ATTACK ON INSTITUTIONS
------------------------------
i still can't understand how we worked out spelling back in the day
shit
...
there had to be so much torture
...
i guess i take a 'optimistic' outlook that
we've moved past public torture for spelling errors
...
not because people have 'evolved'
but because we got 'more cameras'
...
and you don't want to go out without make-up
and have everybody laugh at you

THE GARBAGE PIT
---------------
i'm so bored
usually i just write in a notepad document
and then pick okay ones later
i guess i'm not really doing any 'aggressive' content
... so lame

I AM AN AMERICAN MARXIST
------------------------
is that the guy with the beard?

WINNING
-------
man, i feel like ... so 'mature' and 'adult' 
listening to news sometimes
...
i can't imagine how these words could possibly
worry the kids doing fenty and eating eatother's buttholes
...
but i still sometimes worry that old people would get worried about these words

PREVIEWING SOME VERY FUCKED TECH
--------------------------------
compared to the option i thought would go down
...
this is like a fucking dream
...
'well', ... maybe not
i'm not a big swinger, 
so that's like a huge blind spot
for 'big scheming' for me
...
but i guess the data probably shows that
people are spending all day doing various
sex-related posturing
...
but then there's a lot more 'good intention'
but i don't know if it's just
predictable vanity being farmed
