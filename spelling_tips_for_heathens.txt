CASTLES
-------
sometimes, i feel like the base-behavior 
for all science, art
... basically anything cool
is for some rich person to 'collect' it
...
just imagine if that'd been going on for several thousand years!

KEEPING UP WITH THE KAR ... CHINA

rush more
i'm confused

SYMBOLIC LEAH AND XI VS. REAL LEAH AND XI
-----------------------------------------
i really hope that the 'experts'
at least understand that
i understand that
i have never even met these people
...
okay, maybe do a 'psychology' discussion?
so, i was into jung
and a lot of times, 'stars' represnt
'stars' withing my own psyche
so, whoever i listen to, 
there'll be some symbolic representation
of that character
so, with 'xi' it sort of gets 'intertwined' with the 'ancient emporer' symbol and then 'fat-cat' symbol into the 'xi has a big fake weiner' poem, which i really hope people understand i don't actually think ...
with leah, it clearly got intertwined with a mess of scientological madness.  the rogan interview helped me gain a little less skepticism.  guess it's a symbol of a hollywood person i'm instinctively mistrustful of, but she's probably not cooking up big secret plans.

CONFESSIONS
-----------
man, i'm so bored
...

...
what's something even more silly?
ukrainian not-not-sees?
...
ugh
...
i suck
...
is not-not-see a 'double twist' move?
...
i guess 'eco-friendly cruise' and 'woke service-economy' are still the funniest
...
why can't i write cool shit all the time?
...
all this 'not-cool' writing as 'evidence' of my 'self-victimhood' or whatever 'bads' in the big word science thing

BEAUTIFUL WORDS THAT COMFORT THE GODS LIKE RAIN
-----------------------------------------------
shit!
