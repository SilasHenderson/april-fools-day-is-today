NO STARS TO BOOT
----------------
mom is information
dad is information
that's just
misinformation and 
disinformation

SPIKED PUNCH
------------
flashback to 1970's
...
manz 1: i'm gene tickey. i'm spiking da punch bowl
manz 2: coo
manz 3: i'm gozirra now
manz 2: coo
manz 1: that's PRESIDENT gozirra to you!

SHAKE my SPEAR
--------------
"to be or not to be?"
- that is the question
"are you fucking with me?"
- that is the ALWAYS question

HUNTER-A-CHU
------------
here's the pokemon recipe for '-----' type guys:
- spike da punch to give some dudes huge weiners
  to the point where they essentially are
  'predictable maniacs'
  because they have this 'big urge'
  and then have to develop a 
  'personality'

GREAT NEW SCHEMES FOR PROFIT AND SUCCESS
----------------------------------------
- eco-friendly cruise line
- woke service-economy

HOW WE DEAL WITH SOCIETAL PAIN
------------------------------
outlaw pain medicine
because those people taking pain medicine
are ... SELFISH!

NERD 'SOLVING REALITY' AT BREAK-NECK SPEED
------------------------------------------
who's got your belly?

~ experimental word science ~

THE WOOD BEE
------------
flexing on jung: 
i cracked a whole tree
take that! (oo, and some cool light stuff just now)

HISTORICAL FLEXES
-----------------
ugh i'd get in trouble

PLOTTING
--------
so, i wrote like 45,000 lines
over the last couple months
sadly, i've already tried to self-censor the crazy shit
like, i dunno
i was reading that shit
and it's like a 'q' person's wet dream ... or something

NO ONE ACTUALLY READ FREUD OR JUNG THEY JUST PRETEND
----------------------------------------------------
god damnit
okay, here's a story
jung and freud are talking at a table
they're having a disagreement
jung says that the ceiling is about to crack
freud says he's crazy
then, the ceiling cracks
and that's the end of their friendship

DENNIS RICHIE TYPE GUYS
-----------------------
so, i think there's some people
a really small number
that actually get to see the upper class
and then it's just so absurd
the contrast between 'our' upper class
and 'the' upper class
go write a troff function!
...
an example is:
- everybody knows turkeys don't fly
  and other stupid mini-examples
  just enough to realize i don't know shit
  a little bit higher up is wood cracking stuff
  and then the higher shit is weird and i don't know
  a flying turkey is about as much 'magic' as i get to experience
  god-dammit
  ...
  hello world!
  
PERSONAL HERO STORIES
---------------------
i guess i built up two 'hero stories' over the years
- dennis richie for computers
- john coltrane for music
...
in a way, davinci was a hero, but it was more a mystery
'how could someone possibly get so good at art?'
...
like, i was listening to an early take of giant steps
and for a while, felt like he could fly
...
is that bad?
...
it was really motivating ...
like ... someone practiced a lot and then reaches a level i can't get to but they're generous enough to communicate it
...
unlike the who?

CASTLES
-------
sometimes, i feel like the base-behavior 
for all science, art
... basically anything cool
is for some rich person to 'collect' it
...
just imagine if that'd been going on for several thousand years!

EVERYTHING IS SO FUCKING OBVIOUS IF YOU JUST WOULDN'T GO INSANE WHENEVER YOU TRY TO SPELL
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
english is a great language!
i never have any questions about letters, ordering, tenses, ... or anything!
...
how do you not see the obvious historical corruption?
...
i think people just perceive words completely left-brain
like, never think about the shapes, letters ... anything that might confuse them
... gotta look 'smart'
...
hitler example?
...
there was an example of one stupid shape hypnotizing everybody
that's a good reason to not have people try to figure out 26 shapes

THE CHAIN GAME: WORDS EDITION
-----------------------------
people's emotions affect the
evolution of language
...
whaaaa?

DEBBIE
------
what they'd call disinfo board in prison
... fuckin' debbie!

GOOGLEY EYES
------------
kids don't remember the 90's internet
people are fucked up
...
wow, times are really different!
it's like ... the opposite of punk?

OR
--
your well come (a hilarious orwell joke)

'BIG GAME'
----------
read brave new world
i think that's closer to now
than 1984
and no one probably even read that

CRYING LIKE WINSTON
-------------------
why?
i won a ton!
