NO STARS TO BOOT
----------------
mom is information
dad is information
that's just
misinformation and 
disinformation

SPIKED PUNCH
------------
flashback to 1970's
...
manz 1: i'm gene tickey. i'm spiking da punch bowl
manz 2: coo
manz 3: i'm gozirra now
manz 2: coo
manz 1: that's PRESIDENT gozirra to you!

SHAKE my SPEAR
--------------
"to be or not to be?"
- that is the question
"are you fucking with me?"
- that is the ALWAYS question

HUNTER-A-CHU
------------
here's the pokemon recipe for '-----' type guys:
- spike da punch to give some dudes huge weiners
  to the point where they essentially are
  'predictable maniacs'
  because they have this 'big urge'
  and then have to develop a 
  'personality'

GREAT NEW SCHEMES FOR PROFIT AND SUCCESS
----------------------------------------
- eco-friendly cruise line
- woke service-economy

HOW WE DEAL WITH SOCIETAL PAIN
------------------------------
outlaw pain medicine
because those people taking pain medicine
are ... SELFISH!

NERD 'SOLVING REALITY' AT BREAK-NECK SPEED
------------------------------------------
who's got your belly?

CASTLES
-------
sometimes, i feel like the base-behavior 
for all science, art
... basically anything cool
is for some rich person to 'collect' it
...
just imagine if that'd been going on for several thousand years!

KEEPING UP WITH THE KAR ... CHINA
---------------------------------
rush ya
rush more
i'm confused

COPY YOUR WAY TO SUCCESS
------------------------
a really sad and difficult problem in ... academia?

CRYING LIKE WINSTON
-------------------
why?
i won a ton!

DEBBIE
------
what they'd call disinfo board in prison
... fuckin' debbie!

I AM SINGLE-HANDEDLY SAVING THE PLANET
--------------------------------------

WORD HATE METER
---------------
don't you know tea left?

MOONSHOT KNOW-IT-ALL
--------------------
a passing feeling of oneness
can leave you
chasing ... who?

YOU
---
'you' sometimes is like ... a really agressive word
it's like the '3' of the word kingdom

MY FAVORITE QUOTE FROM THE INTERNET
-----------------------------------
"if nuclear war saves just one life, it'll be worth it"

INNER ANGST
-----------
no, it's DEFINITELY that!

IS INNER ANGST PHYSICS?
-----------------------
cue 'honest track' bezos conspiracy
... or some shit

A SILLY EXAMPLE OF INDIRECTION
------------------------------
't' stands for ... 'testosterone!'

I AM JESUS: THE SEQUEL
----------------------
okay, fine!
't' stands for ... testosterone
...
't' was a real problem back when they were developing language
everybody knows
oh, oh, oh!

TESTOSTERONE JESUS
------------------
hi ... my name is 'tj'

RAND PAUL IS TOTALLY NOT POPULAR
--------------------------------
it's sort of hilarious to see someone 
study a lot and then speak to a
completely unmoved void

ANGST MAP
---------
fancy brain
stupid brain

JENGA
-----
'construct validation'

SYMBOLIC LEAH AND XI VS. REAL LEAH AND XI
-----------------------------------------
i really hope that the 'experts'
at least understand that
i understand that
i have never even met these people
...
okay, maybe do a 'psychology' discussion?
so, i was into jung
and a lot of times, 'stars' represnt
'stars' withing my own psyche
so, whoever i listen to, 
there'll be some symbolic representation
of that character
so, with 'xi' it sort of gets 'intertwined' with the 'ancient emporer' symbol and then 'fat-cat' symbol into the 'xi has a big fake weiner' poem, which i really hope people understand i don't actually think ...
with leah, it clearly got intertwined with a mess of scientological madness.  the rogan interview helped me gain a little less skepticism.  guess it's a symbol of a hollywood person i'm instinctively mistrustful of, but she's probably not cooking up big secret plans.

CONFESSIONS
-----------
man, i'm so bored
...
okay
... 
gotta have a big 'writing' plan for today
...
i've got to spend at least 4 hours today writing
on this yoga mat
...
confessions are too lame
played out
...
gotta cook up ... a BIG PLAN!
...
re-edit 'game of iron'?
...
i've got to achieve ... MORAL VIRTUE!

CANADIAN NAZIS
--------------
okay ... people will believe anything
...
maybe at least just push it further?
to make the tragedy more apparent?
...
what's something even more silly?
ukrainian not-not-sees?
...
ugh
...
i suck
...
is not-not-see a 'double twist' move?
...
i guess 'eco-friendly cruise' and 'woke service-economy' are still the funniest
...
why can't i write cool shit all the time?
...
all this 'not-cool' writing as 'evidence' of my 'self-victimhood' or whatever 'bads' in the big word science thing

BEAUTIFUL WORDS THAT COMFORT THE GODS LIKE RAIN
-----------------------------------------------
shit!
i guess i've got to do more
'p --> r'
...
rich people want rain, not pain
they want to get washed, not challenged
...
going on this abstraction, as more SYMBOLIC FUCKING CHARACTERS
then, 
... ooops i forgot
ego stuff
...
defensiveness
...
trapped into worried about
'defending my triangle'
...
ummm

WEAKNESS IS INSANITY
--------------------
rich people wear stilts
so tall, so tall
poor people will build
so small, so small

BIG POWER BUSINESS MANZ
-----------------------
these guys always ...
i never give the 'big dick' vibe to them
...
why don't they just look at my dick?
...
why does 'stupid haircut' mean: i'm retarded and have a little dick?
...
people are so fucked up

KKKLEEEEEEEEN
-------------
i really hope one day i'll
get really into hygiene
...
ugh
...
and looking in the mirror alot
so people don't think i'm crazy
...
at least i'm showering more

MIRROR OF TRUTH
---------------
sanity means:
- looking in the mirror before you go out
  so people don't laugh at you
...
what i'm saying is ... back in the day
it was really obvious that people would 
hypnotize themselves with mirrors
...
now, you're crazy not to!

SUIT
----
it's so stupid that a 'long tie'
totally 'gets' people
that we 'bury it'
over and over

BERRY CRUNCH
------------
sometimes i think 
the whole earth is filled
with crazy fucking tragedy
and the diggers, the old archeologists
just found so much fucked up 'hypnosis shit'
and other madness
that they decided it's better
to just burn all that
and not see it
...
but then there's this weird problem
of jenga
...
i don't understand

GRAPPLING STUPIDLY WITH COMPLEXITY
----------------------------------
i'll try to edit this stuff later
writing and then 'posting'
feels more fun
now now now!

A HABITABLE ENVIRONMENT 'OUT OF CHAOS'
--------------------------------------
man, i really like this ... who is it?
jordan peterson interview

A CRUDE POINT
-------------
here i go again!

ANOTHER 'EXPLANATION' OF A 'POPULAR FIGURE'
-------------------------------------------
i don't think jay-z is an 'illuminati wizard'
here's a 'math' explanation
it's 'indirection' + 'derivatives'
and a funny, 'no-solution' problem
J: 'you do indirection for the illuminati'
Z: 'no i don't'

THE WORST DORK JOKE
-------------------

...
who is loo?

MORE MINDLESS GARBAGE
---------------------
why can't i think of something cool?
shit, i'm so bored

GIFTS FROM SANTA
----------------
oh, here's one:
i'm not a 'burn down the government' type
there's another side of 'the mystery'
that's: 'how did we not all blow everything up already?'
...
like ...
if i listened to 'my favorite things'
i'd probably seem way more 'safe'
than if i listened to 'interstellar space'
...
but they're both from the same person!
...
and then there's this really sad thing
where everybody already forgot so much music
that coltrane's last album seems 'crazy and pained'
...
that's a really convenient attitude to take towards something you didn't study!
...
so, with that example it's like
'i studied major and minor scales and 4/4 and 3/4 time, so that sounds 'sane' to me'
and if they hear 'not major and minor scales' then it sounds 'bad and stupid'
...
doesn't it make sense how we forget things?
...
it happens with music
...
keeping a culture together is ...
too complicated for me to understand
...
ugh
...

AT LEAST I'M NOT USING MY PRIVELEDGE FOR WAR AND OTHER HORRORS
--------------------------------------------------------------
so ...
i'm a ... big angry ... word writer?

A GRAVE ATTACK ON INSTITUTIONS
------------------------------
i still can't understand how we worked out spelling back in the day
shit
...
there had to be so much torture
...
i guess i take a 'optimistic' outlook that
we've moved past public torture for spelling errors
...
not because people have 'evolved'
but because we got 'more cameras'
...
and you don't want to go out without make-up
and have everybody laugh at you

THE GARBAGE PIT
---------------
i'm so bored
usually i just write in a notepad document
and then pick okay ones later
i guess i'm not really doing any 'aggressive' content
... so lame

I AM AN AMERICAN MARXIST
------------------------
is that the guy with the beard?

WINNING
-------
man, i feel like ... so 'mature' and 'adult' 
listening to news sometimes
...
i can't imagine how these words could possibly
worry the kids doing fenty and eating eatother's buttholes
...
but i still sometimes worry that old people would get worried about these words

PREVIEWING SOME VERY FUCKED TECH
--------------------------------
compared to the option i thought would go down
...
this is like a fucking dream
...
'well', ... maybe not
i'm not a big swinger, 
so that's like a huge blind spot
for 'big scheming' for me
...
but i guess the data probably shows that
people are spending all day doing various
sex-related posturing
...
but then there's a lot more 'good intention'
but i don't know if it's just
predictable vanity being farmed

GIVING UP ON BIG GAME
---------------------
i guess i didn't 'study' enough 
at probably the two most 'powerful' subjects
- sex
- hypnosis
because those sound gross
...
so i guess i feel it's another situation where
there's 'experts' who can use their 'expertise'
to make me look 'not smart'
like ... here's some evidence that i didn't study sex and hypnosis enough to be a 'good person'
- ugh, this is too depressing

CAMERA

look good for santa

PRESENTS FOR PEASANTS!

JACK, DOOR, SEE
---------------
a jack in the box
a door
a ... vision!

AAA CAR INSURANCE
-----------------
aaah, real monsters!

COME ON, COMPUTER!
------------------
why does the stupid internet slow down 
with 'big names'?
...
okay ... so now i'm definitely gonna do some more 'spicy' content
does this make sense?
now, with my internet slowing down, 
i'm starting to picture jack as a priveledge sf dude
going to india or something and having a 'total recall' type meditation
and comes back feeling 'enlightened'
but still gets FUCKING PISSED for some reason all the time

THE LAMEST POSSIBLE LOSS
------------------------
jack dorsey gets super pissed at my 'aaa' poem
and then i can't have any toys
... and then i die
... and then ...

YO DAWG, WHAT HAPPENS LIKE ... 'AFTER' LIFE?
--------------------------------------------
deep, go watch 
veep in a 
jeep

CLOUDY TYPES
------------
i don't think i've done any 'anti-zuckerberg' content
maybe i would have written that during my 'white people are devils and so am i' period
ugh
i guess the main unspoken thing with him and a lot of people
is, they get really successful, then get an asian wife to help them
and they don't stay 'totally white' or maybe more lightly worded ...
... less 'american cowboy'
and people haven't really thought about spelling
alien vs. 
asian
so ...
that's NOT SAYING aliens are asians
...
just, you could see how some schemer like crowley
could totally just think it's hilarious
to draw a picture of a 'super-asian'
and then that's what everybody thinks
an 'alien' looks like
...
it stuck to people's subconcious desire ... or some shit

PSYCHO-ANAL-ISIS
----------------
ugh
one of these days, 
i'm gonna start studying again

IDEAS FOR SOLVING THE CENSORSHIP PROBLEM
----------------------------------------
i think musk might have been correct
a population with a lot of speed
and not enough mushrooms to balance it
...
like ... does that make sense?
...
okay, here's 'run-down' for newbs:
- speed makes you want to 'achieve' and 'be great'
- mushrooms make you 'mellow' and 'skeptical'
...
like ...
it's so obvious that all the harvard kids
are on a lot of adderall
it's not bad, 
just ...
scary to see a kid with so much speed power
that hasn't emotionally developed yet
...
so, mushrooms could at least help those
'high energy' people
question themselves a little more
to not make too many concepts
'precious and sacred'
before they've finished developing
...
but, i mean, let's be honest
ritalin and adderall help people study
...
the rich people ($ not 'super' rich) all take it, then 
get 'worried' about how 'peasants' might
not be as cool as them
... or something

WHAT I THINK THE 'HIGHEST LEVEL' LOOKS LIKE
-------------------------------------------
really, really boring people
who mainly have to learn personal skills
... or something
but we live in america, so we don't have as long of a history
and there aren't as many institutions
so ... it's like the
'biggest american cowboy'
is a 'feasible strategy'
to achieve 'ultimate power'
and they don't seem to understand
history ever happened
and that anyone could ever have ever
done anything more before
...
ugh

HERE I GO AGAIN
---------------
so, here's summore 'white devil' proof
...
at the white-house correspondents dinner, 
their 'media darlings'
were porno people
...
they are ku ... ku ... insane!

I SEE WHAT'S GOING ON
---------------------
word people take words actually
... literaly

'LITERALLY' MEANS 'WORDLY' NOT 'ACTUALLY'
-----------------------------------------
literally!

LITTER ALLIES
-------------
swaaaaamp

GOZIRRA!
--------
at some point, people's wordy worry
has to seem silly

WAITING FOR JULIO
-----------------
we crushed everything cool for so long
that everything is 1930's basketball
...
only now ... if you're okay at anything ... you're a 'secret agent'
...
we're wayyy past 1984!

I INHABIT SOME DISEMBODIED UNIVERSE
-----------------------------------
well, yeah
i am doing words right now

A DEFINITELY SEXIST COMMENT
---------------------------
girls are wayy less likely to want to bone me
if i focus conversation on my own excitement about the structure of html documents
sample:
- 'so today i learn html documents are made of 'elements' and the 'elements' are made of 'opening' and 'closing' tags, and the tags each start with opening and closing brackets, but some elements don't need a closing tag but they all need opening and closing brackets and then you can stack and make like trees with the structures and it's sort of like painting, no seriously it's interesting it's like a book only it can also do magic ... or something ... why are you leaving? ... oops

WHY ISN'T HTML DOCUMENT THEORY SEXY?
------------------------------------
yo...
yo yo
we got 'dat
html
... dawg
and 
...
god dammit this sucks

OTHER PROBABLY BAD OPENERS FOR FIRST DATE WITH WOMANZ
-----------------------------------------------------
- "i've been watching fox news"
- "i think everybody is insane except me.  i'm not insane but i don't know if you might be.  does that make sense?"
- "you know, ted cruz is actually pretty smart"
- "you ever think the moon is a space ship? like REAALLY think about it?"
- "i've been seriously writing about how everybody is obsessed with weiner and vagina"
- "do you think we're all in hell? cuz i do"
- "i've been thinking about hitler ... like as a symbol used to ... no not like that ... shit"
- "big up ... what? i just wanted to see how you'd react ... what? creepy? no, i totally know what 'big up' means ... i mean, like ... pshhh, ... howbout, you tell me? cuz ... that's like ... the REAL question ... cuz i totally know ... cuz i'm cool ... i'm cool ... right? you think i'm cool right?

ALL YOU SEE IS KOOPAS EVERYWHERE

when people experience 'bad', they:
- 'id the bad'
- 'kill the bad'

EXPERTS TALKING ABOUT RESPONSIBILITY
------------------------------------
everyone just abandons their parents and then has cool hair and talks about morals

BOMBING ON THE RECORD
---------------------
so, i already thought about the whole
'is practice illegal now?' thing
with words ...
there's different words combos that scare me
and, in order to 'find medicine'
...
ugh
...
i forget so many people never learn about mistakes
...
scared of being laughed at
forever
and never
ever
try

I DO AND SO SHOULD YOU
----------------------
there's only a small number of viable explanations
because that's all i can think of

THE ACID TEST
-------------
we had to outlaw acid
because our scientists are so nuts
that they have bad trips
and then the science is
'acid is bad'

STRAGEDY
--------
can i just start making up words and nft'ing them?
...
it's MY word
not yours
...
you're not checked out on it
...
you'd probably hurt yourself using a cool word like stragedy
...
go bake a cake newb
...
man, i'm so great
